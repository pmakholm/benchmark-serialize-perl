Standard benchmark structures
=============================

This directory contains a couple of standard benchamark structures for use
with Benchmark::Serialize. All benchmarks can be run with the 'run.pl'
script with a subdirectory name as argument.

  small           - Just a very simple hash
  jvm-serializers - Taken from http://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers
  google-data     - http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/developer-calendar@google.com/public/full?alt=json

Each subdirectory contains a 'structure.pl' containing the structure, possibly
a 'structure.proto' for use with Google::ProtocolBufferes, and possibly a
'StructureXS' module made with protobuf-perlxs.
