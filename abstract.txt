So you need to serialize some data? Let me count the ways to skin that camel
(LMCTWTSTC)!

Somewhere between 25 and 50 modules on CPAN just doing that. Why are there so
many? Which one is the right one for you? How can you decide which one to use?
Is there a One True Serialization Module? 

For more questions please attend this lightning talk.
